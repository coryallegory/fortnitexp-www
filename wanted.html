                    I will buy one plate or an entire collection to get what I need, <b>and I am always looking to purchase back my grandfather's #52 Manitoba license plates from 1911-1926. They were stolen from our family home while my father was fighting during WW2</b>.

                    I don't care how, or who you acquired them from. Too much water has passed under the bridge in seventy-five years. My family and I would just like to complete the run of #52 plates from 1911 to 1926 as they were originally issued to my grandfather.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Please Note: we are in possession of the original 1911 disc, and fellow collector Ed Marchuck was kind enough to trade back to us #52's from 1918 and 1919. That still leaves a number of #52's out there somewhere. I would appreciate your help.
