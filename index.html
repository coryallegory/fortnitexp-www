            <h2>How to Earn XP</h2>
      
            If your goal is to earn experience (XP or EXP) points in Fortnite: Battle Royale, there are a few basic strategies you might consider, from what I think are best to worst:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Play or Idle in Creative Mode for at least 75 minutes (60,000 XP/day)</li>
              <li>Complete your Daily Bonus Goal each day (45,750 XP/day)</li>
              <li>Complete Season Quests and Bonus Goals (25,000 XP/quest + 165,000 XP/tier)</li>
              <li>Complete Character Quests (200,000 XP)</li>
              <li>Complete Milestone Quests (8,000 XP/quest + 40,000 XP/tier)</li>
              <li>Play game modes like Team Rumble where you can eliminate a lot of opponents and open a lot of chests with guaranteed spawn rates.</li>
              <li>Open all items and pick up all foragable items you come across (small amounts of XP add up)</li>
              <li>Play Imposters or Tilted Taxis game mode when they are available (5,000-10,000+ XP/game)</li>
            </ol>
      
            <h2>Sources of Experience Points (XP)</h2>
            <div>
              Here are more details on each of the major sources of XP:
            </div>
            <ul class="border d-inline-block pr-2 py-2">
              <li>Creative Mode XP</li>
              <li>Quests (Punchcards and Phone Booths)</li>
              <li>General Gameplay</li>
              <li>Impostors game mode</li>
              <li>Supercharged XP (Meh)</li>
              <li>Teammate XP Boost (?)</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Creative Mode XP</h3>
            <div>
              Playing Creative Mode, in any game type or even idling in the Hub, is a consistently effective way of earning XP.
              <br />
              Up to 60,000 XP can be earned per day for simply existing in Creative. Every 15 minutes you are awarded 12,000 XP up to 5 times. It starts over at the same time the Daily Quests reset for the day, which is currently 9am EST.
              <br />
              Some creative game modes earn (relatively modest) XP for certain in-game activities as well, so I encourage you to explore the hundreds, if not thousands of Creative game modes available.
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Quests</h3>
            <div>
              Quests are the main way players will earn free in-game cosmetics and XP. As with each Season before it, the format of the quest system has changed again for Chapter 3, Season 1.
              <br />
              The following are only available in the Team Rumble and Battle Royale game modes (Solo, Duos, Trios, Squads):
              <br />
              <ul class="list-group list-group-flush border p-2 mx-2">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Daily Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  Players should see three Daily Quests available to them. Once they are completed, they should refill up to three available for your next round. (Note there seems to be a bug where leaving Creative mode removes all of your Daily quests. You'll need to restart your game.)
                  <br />
                  Squadmates can complete (and also earn XP from) the active Daily quests of their teammates.
                  <br />
                  Each Daily Quest is worth 250 XP.
                  <br />
                  There is also Daily Bonus Goal, which for the moment is completing a certain number of daily quests. This will award 3x 15,000 XP.
                  <br />
                  Daily Bonus Goal resets at 9am EST each day.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Season Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  So far it looks like Season Quests are released on Thursdays, and may or may not expire after a period of time depending on the Quest.
                  <br />
                  Each Season Quest is worth 25,000 XP.
                  <br />
                  There are Season Bonus Goals which involve completing a certain number of Season Quests.
                  <br />
                  Tier 1 Season Bonus Goals are worth 3x 55,000 XP each.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Milestone Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  Milestone Quests last for the the entire season, and reward you for completing in-game activities.
                  <br />
                  Each Milestone Quest is worth 8,000 XP.
                  <br />
                  There are Milestone Bonus Goals which involve completing a certain number of Milestone Quests.
                  <br />
                  Tier 1 Milestone Bonus Goals are worth 2x 20,000 XP each.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Character Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  Character Quests last for the the remainder of the season, and reward you for completing activities which are thematic to various characters as they are revealed.
                  <br />
                  Each Character Quest is worth 20,000 XP.
                  <br />
                  There are Character Bonus Goals which involve completing a certain number of Milestone Quests.
                  <br />
                  Character Bonus Goals reward various cosmetic items and/or XP.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">General Gameplay</h3>
            <div>
              Opening chests, ammo boxes, freezers, safes, llamas, drops award XP.
              <br/>
              Collecting foraged items awards XP.
              <br/>
              Eliminating players and other in-game activities will all assign XP.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoy the game and the XP will follow :)
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Impostors Game Mode</h3>
            <div>
              A first-person version of Among Us, this game mode consistently awards roughly 5,000-10,000 XP per game, depending how many tasks you complete and whether you win. If you do join this game mode with aim of earning XP rather than actually playing, be courteous to other players and make sure you at least Skip your votes promptly so as not to ruin the game.
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Supercharged XP (Meh)</h3>
            <div>
              This doesn't award extra XP so much as it catches you up on a little bit of the XP you missed by not playing the day before.
              <p />
              If you didn't complete all of your Daily Punchcard from the day before you may notice your XP bar glowing gold and labelled SUPERCHARGED XP. I haven't verified the exact numbers myself, but the idea is that supercharged status grants a 5x multiplier on any XP earned, up until you earn 30,000 XP (this amount may have changed in the 18.10 update, given that Daily Punchcard XP has increased from 51,000 to 90,000 XP).
              <p />
              It's a way for you to skip a day or more of Eat-Sleep-Fortnite (seriously, go outside) and still keep up a bit of your leveling pace. If you're looking to min-max the XP grinding strategies, note that this is far less than simply doing your Daily Punchcard quests and creative idling each day (216,000 XP).
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Teammate XP Boost (?)</h3>
            <div>
              I'm not certain this is still a thing in Battle Royale, but some people claim that at certain levels of the Battle Pass, when playing in a party with members of your Friends List, in-game XP is earned with a multiplier. This would be very useful, but I haven't ever noticed it in effect while playing myself.
            </div>
