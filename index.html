            <h2>How to Earn XP</h2>
      
            If your goal is to earn experience (XP or EXP) points in Fortnite: Battle Royale, there are a few basic strategies you might consider, from what I think are best to worst:
            <ol type="1">
              <li>Complete your Daily Punchcard each day (225,000 XP/day)</li>
              <li>Play or Idle in Creative Mode for at least 75 minutes (126,000 XP/day)</li>
              <li>Complete your Weekly Punchcard every week (225k-270k XP/week)</li>
              <li>Complete Character Punchcards (150,000 XP)</li>
              <li>Replay Character Punchcard Quests (2500-3750 XP/quest)</li>
              <li>Play Impostors game mode (5,000-10,000 XP/game)</li>
              <li>Play game modes like Team Rumble where you can eliminate a lot of opponents and open a lot of chests with guaranteed spawn rates.</li>
              <li>Open all items and pick up all foragable items you come across (small amounts of XP add up)</li>
              <li>Play Tilted Taxis game mode when it is available</li>
            </ol>
      
            <h2>Sources of Experience Points (XP)</h2>
            <div>
              Here are more details on each of the major sources of XP:
            </div>
            <ul class="border d-inline-block pr-2 py-2">
              <li>Creative Mode XP</li>
              <li>Quests (Punchcards and Phone Booths)</li>
              <li>General Gameplay</li>
              <li>Impostors game mode</li>
              <li>Supercharged XP (Meh)</li>
              <li>Teammate XP Boost (?)</li>
            </ul>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Creative Mode XP</h3>
            <div>
              Playing Creative Mode, in any game type or even idling in the Hub, is the most consistently effective way of earning XP.
              <br />
              Up to 126,000 XP can be earned per day. Every 15 minutes you are awarded 25,200 XP up to 5 times. It starts over at the same time the Daily Quests reset for the day, which is currently 9am EST.
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Quests</h3>
            <div>
              Quests are the main way players will earn free in-game cosmetics and XP. Players have four slots available for active quests, which can be filled by either using Phone Booths or talking to characters around the map (Battle Royale only, they don't spawn in Team Rumble). Quests can be fulfilled by any member of your Party, you'll see your teammates quests in your list as well. Interestingly, Team Rumble and Battle Royale maintain separate Quest slots, so you can't flip between modes to carry on questlines directly. When you pick up a new set of quests, they always start at the first (Uncommon) level, and progress upwards. You're able to remove active quests to make room for new ones (although you'll always start over at 1/5).
              <br /><br />
              As for the Quests themselves, there are several different types which award different amounts of XP:
              <ul class="list-group list-group-flush border p-2 mx-2">
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Common (Grey) Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  These are the the first (1/5) stage quests assigned from Character Punchcards. They're worth 30,000 XP the first time you complete them. Completing them again is subsequently worth 2500 XP.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Uncommon (Green) Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  Five of these now appear on your Daily Punchcard, and usually require you to complete quests from character punchcards. These expire after 24 hours, and award 45k XP each.
                  <br />
                  They are also the second (2/5) stage quests assigned from characters, which will award 30,000 XP the first time they're completed. Completing them again is subsequently worth 2650 XP.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Rare (Blue) Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  These the third (3/5) stage quests assigned from Character Punchcards, which will award 30,000 XP the first time they're completed. Completing them again is subsequently worth 2750 XP.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Epic (Purple) Quests</b>
                  <br />
                  They are the fourth (4/5) stage quests assigned from Character Punchcards, which will award 30,000 XP the first time they're completed.  Completing them again is subsequently worth 2900 XP.
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item">
                  <b>Legendary (Gold) Quests</b>
                  <br/>
                  They are the fifth (5/5) stage quests assigned from Character Punchcards, which will award 30,000 XP the first time they're completed.  Completing them again is subsequently worth 3750 XP.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">General Gameplay</h3>
            <div>
              Opening chests, ammo boxes, freezers, safes, llamas, drops award XP.
              <br/>
              Collecting foraged items awards XP.
              <br/>
              Eliminating players and other in-game activities will all assign XP.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              Enjoy the game and the XP will follow :)
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Impostors Game Mode</h3>
            <div>
              A first-person version of Among Us, this game mode consistently awards roughly 5,000-10,000 XP per game, depending how many tasks you complete and whether you win. If you do join this game mode with aim of earning XP rather than actually playing, be courteous to other players and make sure you at least Skip your votes promptly so as not to ruin the game.
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Supercharged XP (Meh)</h3>
            <div>
              This doesn't award extra XP so much as it catches you up on a little bit of the XP you missed by not playing the day before.
              <p />
              If you didn't complete all of your Daily Punchcard from the day before you may notice your XP bar glowing gold and labelled SUPERCHARGED XP. I haven't verified the exact numbers myself, but the idea is that supercharged status grants a 5x multiplier on any XP earned, up until you earn 30,000 XP (this amount may have changed in the 18.10 update, given that Daily Punchcard XP has increased from 51,000 to 90,000 XP).
              <p />
              It's a way for you to skip a day or more of Eat-Sleep-Fortnite (seriously, go outside) and still keep up a bit of your leveling pace. If you're looking to min-max the XP grinding strategies, note that this is far less than simply doing your Daily Punchcard quests and creative idling each day (216,000 XP).
            </div>
      
            <h3 class="mt-2">Teammate XP Boost (?)</h3>
            <div>
              I'm not certain this is still a thing in Battle Royale, but some people claim that at certain levels of the Battle Pass, when playing in a party with members of your Friends List, in-game XP is earned with a multiplier. This would be very useful, but I haven't ever noticed it in effect while playing myself.
            </div>
      
            <br /><br />
